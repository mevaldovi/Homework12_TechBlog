# Agknowledgments
A special thanks to my classmate [Jacob Guiro](https://github.com/Jguiro09) for letting me reference his code for the routes and steal over all his handlebars templates to use, as well as the css references, and some of the js code in the public folder.

"Last, but not least, I would like to thank me. I want to thank me for believing in me, I want to thank me for doing all this hard work. I wanna thank me for having no days off. I wanna thank me for never quitting. I wanna thank me for always been a giver and trying to give more than I receive. I want to thank me for trying to do more right than wrong. I want to thank me for just being me at all times.‚Äù --Snoop Dog
